            Aspects that worked for assignment 3 was our communication  and teamwork which was really good throughout the assignment period. We were
            always talking on our group chat discussing work and figuring what our next step would be. We also had at
            least one meeting per week on Microsoft teams which helped us verbally discuss ideas and hoe everyone was
            going with their assigned work. One thing that could be improved could be our time management. Sometimes I
            was late to a meeting or didn't have my work done on time when someone else needed it, could have been a bit
            more productive and less lazy however all the work got done in the end without any problems. One thing that
            was surprising was our ability to get all our work done and communicate while we are in lockdown. It would
            have been much easier if we could meet up and show our work to each other in person as well as helping each
            other but we all pulled through and got our work done. One thing I learned about groups is that it is a lot
            easier to do work in a group because with regular meetings you can get a lot of work done, you can also help
            each our with things you done understand , bounce ideas of each other and it lightens the work load all
            round.

            The constant group meetings throughout the process of the assignment really made communication between the
            group both clear and effective. This greatly helped in keeping everyone on top of their various assigned
            tasks as we would set each other due dates and uphold certain expectations of each of our members. This
            setup also allowed for some independence within our group as we would be able to do our tasks on our own
            first and then regroup and discuss feedback and if it was representative of the collective team idea.
            Although we were quite on top of tasks with group meetings and conversations, I believe that we may have
            overestimated the time needed for certain tasks and may have been a bit too lenient with group due dates as
            a result. For next time I think something like better planning may need to be implemented at the start of the
            project for a more concise and accurate timeline and work of what needs to be done and when. One thing that surprised
            me regarding this assignment was the great organizational and communication skills shown by our team in regards to our regular
            meetings and delegation of tasks which was  an improvement from assignment 2. I was quite happy with how we effectively used each person's skills to the
            group advantage such as Nathan and his knowledge in CSS and Ahnaf and his great leadership ability in being
            able to actively stay on top of task checklists. This overall was a pleasant surprise as I feel like our
            group worked quite autonomously with very few issues as a result of this. I have learned through this
            assignment that with effective leadership and clear communication, group tasks can be managed in an
            effective and productive manner. wwwe also could of implemented more such as a working prototype of the 
            project.
        </p>
        <h2>Ahnaf</h2>
        <p>
            Assignment 3 saw some improvements but also highlight many aspects that needed to be worked on. for the group is that we were able to set up a meeting consistently on time every week, as
            well as disucssing ideas and utilizing it with minimal conflict. We were also able to finish a lot of
            tasks needed on time such as finising most of the concepts and write our reports. Improvement in a lot of
            areas can be made as well such as our communication such as every member participating in chat as some were
            more talkative than others. Our time management skills for submitting parts of the project can be improved
            as not everyone in the group was able to complete a certain task in time. Something surprising is our
            interest for I.T and how we were able to discuss various topics about I.T which translated into a lot of
            ideas making it into our assignments such as the design and the topics discussed as well as many of the
            team's members knowledge of HTML and CSS while not vas it is competent. I have learned that time management
            is important in a group as it will help the group become consistent and make working on projects much
            easier. I also learned that the group cannot perform as well if everyone is not putting all their effort
            into it which can drag the group down. we also need to expand our skill sets and be more clear when discussing ideas
        </p>
        <h2>Nathan</h2>
        <p>
            The group performed really well in regards to having consistent and efficient meetings and completing our
            assigned work in a timely and efficient manner, we also had efficient use of teams with using shared word
            documents to assign tasks and monitor the progress of the project in an overall sense. I think we could
            improve our time management at the start of the assignment as it took us a longer than expected time to
            start the small tasks, although we did increase our work output as a whole later in the assignment. One
            thing that surprised me was the amount of communication we were able to facilitate even due to the current
            COVID-19 pandemic. One thing I have learnt about groups is the importance of good communication and set
            roles within a group. E.g. a meeting leader and Technical lead, as this greatly improves the time use both
            during meetings and out of meetings as work is not unnecessarily repeated.

            Most aspects of our assignment flowed without a hitch. We keep each other updated by having at least one
            meeting per week throughout our time working on the assignment. This helped us keep on top of our work and
            we were able to allocate tasks between ourselves smoothly. On a personal level I believe my time management
            and concentration could have been improved. Although I had no problem completing my own allocated work, I
            still found that I was rushing to get work done because I had been focusing on different work before that.
            Because of that I hope to start the next assignment earlier than this one to be more prepared. It surprised
            me that although the COVID-19 lockdown laws are in effect it had little hassle towards our assignment.
            Everyone contributed to the assignment and as a group I felt we worked quite decently even though it was
            completely online. I learned that working in groups is an effective way to reach a goal if everyone puts in;
            each member needs to do their part for a successful group.

        <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
        <p>
            Overall, the group has done a lot of things well and a lot of things that need to be improved upon on. The aspects that worked was our 
            communication and planning which was concise and clear and everyone managed to contribute to discussion which is a big improvement from
             the last assignment where some people in the group who were not as talkative contributed and discussed a lot more than when compared to assignment 2.
              Another positive aspect that came out of assignment 3 was our deeper knowledge of the tools need by this assignment such as the use of GitHub and html and CSS where
               there was discussions on how to implement things with much greater depth than compared to assignment 2 where only a few of the group members knew only some basic elements
               html and CSS. A lot of aspects did not work out as intended in this assignment as well such as us finishing off certain milestones in time or not getting far enough with the
                project which could be attributed to multiple things. Aspect that didn’t work was our underestimation of specific task such as designing and coding the main menu or login screen which was assigned to few little people where it could have been done much better if we left it off to more than 1 person. 
                Another common aspect that didn’t work during this assignment was our ability to agree on things and the design as we all had different ideas on the vision for the project which lead to a lot of delays and dead ends and lastly we should have had a better aim for the project as the aim for this assignment the group made overestimated the abilities of group members which lead to the group doing task which was really difficult to do and implement. 
                Overall In the future as a group we must making more reasonable aim, make a better plan and process for the project and not overestimate or 
            underestimate aspects as it could lead to less than desirable results, as well as finishing deadlines on time.
