        <h1>Project Description</h1>
        <p>Classy for kids is a cloud-based learning alternative to other video chat services such as Teams and Zoom,
            classy is designed for a younger audience of prep to grade 6. Classy can be fully developed with the
            technology that is available today. Classy will be built on a server VM instance where the students will
            have access to said virtual machine, in this instance of the virtual machine the teacher will have to
            ability to control events to start programs open files and close programs. The virtual machine will start a
            video conference with the teacher and the whole class, the teacher will then be able to invite, kick, mute
            students in the session to help moderate the class. The Teacher will be able to interface with the
            cloud-based solution with a simple GUI so that they do not have to learn commands. The services to
            facilitate this solution already exist such as AWS cloud based VM. The software to interface with the VM and
            the video chat software will need to be developed, however similar programs exist such as Teams or Citrix,
            so it can be fully developed at this time. This project will heavily lean on the dependence of cloud-based
            computing and the ready access to servers to run the VM’s weather that is outsourced to a company such as
            Amazon or if the servers are purchased for the project.</p>
        <p>The most likely impact of the development of Classy for kids is schools may look in to providing learning
            from home services for students that need it such as students that are sick or for example have an auto
            immune disease that makes it so that going to school is a higher risk for them to get sick. Due to the ease
            of use of this program and how it will be able to facilitate teaching to school kids in a more efficient way
            while learning remotely is a first. Classy for kids will not make any jobs in schools redundant as it is not
            set out to replace normal in class learning rather it is designed to help those who for one reason or
            another cant attend the school physically not fall behind, or in the case of a pandemic assist in the remote
            learning of students. Classy for kids may have an impact on the current use of video conferencing programs
            such as WebEx or Teams in the use in schools, as Classy for kids comes with its own video conferencing
            software there is no need to pay extra to supplement the software with another video conferencing program,
            as well as it offering features that are more suited to a classroom environment rather than a cooperate
            environment that they were designed around.</p>
        <p>Classy for kids will not affect myself or people over the age of 13 that are not employed in primary school
            education, Classy is aimed at a target audience from prep to grade 6, and due to this it is very locked down
            in what the students can to, this is to help the teacher moderate the class and set assigned tasks as well
            as check the students current process and help then out if needed. Due to the locked down nature of the
            software it is not a good fit for students undertaking higher levels of education as the locked down model
            does not scale well when you are asking students to complete complex tasks involving multiple programs or
            self-directed research. This is going to affect people like my sister, she is in grade 6 so fits in to the
            target demographic, she is at the moment undertaking remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is
            finding it difficult to stay on task and find all the assigned work that is allocated to her. The students
            at the moment are also expected to install CISCO WebEx and learn how to use google classroom without any
            prior training, causing confusion and lost time that could be spend on teaching. Classy aims to dramatically
            reduce the wasted time spend on configuring those solutions by having all the required functions built in to
            one service, this helps the kids as all they have to do is click on a link and sign in with their assigned
            username and password and all the software is pre-installed and ready to go. Classy may also help with the
            adaption of a learn at home model due to its ease of use and the ability for the teacher to check on the
            students and reinforce learning points a lot better than any other method released currently.</p>

        <h1>Detailed Description</h1>
        <h2>Aims</h2>
        <p>
            The main aim to achieve for the development of Classy for Kids is the intercommunication between the web app
            and the VM environments. This would include the development of the web app and is dependent on the smaller
            goals that are also outlined below. This is our main goal because it is the final piece of software to
            develop to let the teachers actually use the software as outlined in the project description, with out this
            it can not meet the original requirements. <br> Some of the smaller goals to help achieve the main goal are
            as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Configure VM environments with pre-installed software. This will involve making a pre-configured
                environment for the VM server to run when a student logs in to the web app, it also includes having all
                the required services pre login to the students account so it is easier to use. This is a goal rather
                than the main aim because although it is necessary to be completed to ensure the most user-friendly
                experience for the students and the teachers, the core function of the software can still be achieved
                with the partial completion of this goal.</li>
            <li>Configure the video conferencing application to auto start and auto connect with a new VM login. This
                goal relates to the original description of the software of having the student auto connect to their
                class when they login, this is a usability feature and there fore is not the core aim as the same as
                above although it does need to be completed Classy can still function without the inclusion of this
                step.</li>
            <li>Program the commands from the web interface to the VM to control opening of programs and files. This
                goal is related to the original description where the teachers are able to click a button on their UI
                and open a file or program on all the students VM instances. This is a core function of the program but
                is still a sub division of the main aim as it related to the development of the web app and VM
                environments. This goal does need to be completed to reach the aim, as without this function Classy is
                not able to meet its original description.</li>
            <li>Organize the acquisition of licenses for the software required. Third part software will be used in
                Classy such as windows for the OS and some type of video conferencing tool that is to be decided later
                on in the project based on both cost and ease of programing the required functions in to it. We are
                going for some programs on licenses because it is decided that redeveloping programs such as the
                operating system is unnecessary and is outside our ability as software developers. This goal needs to be
                completed before Classy is publicly released to avoid issues with legality of using software that is not
                licensed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Goals that are required to be completed to reach the main aim are; Configure VM environments with
            pre-installed software, Program the commands from the web interface to the VM, and the acquisition of the
            required software. The first goal to be dropped in the instance of a time requirement should be the
            Configuration of the video conferencing application, as this can be fixed in a later patch and is not
            required for the core function of the software itself.</p>


    <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>

    <h2>Roles</h2>
    <p>
        For this process, the roles of this group are not specific compared to last assignment as it is easier and more
        efficient to structure the group like this. One of the reasons for not giving a specific a specific role is
        availability, since when a meeting starts many of the members might not be present or attend this also applies
        to the leader like technical lead where the person with the most experience become technical lead until the
        original technical lead comes back. This could also apply to technical development where one person may know one
        area of the task assigned but have no idea of another so in order to assist with that, the person with the most
        technical know-how will be assigned to that role. Another reason might be that one group member might be
        confident in leading a specific task for the group and have a lot of knowledge of the specific task assigned and
        allows them to build on skills they might be lacking such as leadership or communication and allows them to grow
        that skill as they might be confident in that area of work and knows how to communicate it much better than they
        would other task. Lastly it will allow the team to do different task so they can be more engaged with the
        project and get assigned roles they might not be as comfortable such as a technical lead or design lead and help
        develop those sorts of skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
    <p>
        For our proof of concept we have prioritized the concept of remotely controlling a virtual machine in order to
        control students computers for educational purposes. This sets our secondary goal of the simplifying of the base
        OS for the easy and efficient use by a younger demographic to the side while we figure out the base framework
        that the application will run on. Due to this our scope is set as “building a successful remote virtual machine
        solution that we are able to widely distribute to the public”. For the sake of simplicity within this project we
        have decided that the base prototype model for this program will be a Windows OS based system. To achieve this
        we will be developing a .iso virtual image of a Window 10 based operating system with pre-installed remote
        desktop functionality, a file sharing database and the appropriate software settings to support these programs.
        We will not be designing the teacher/ host version of this operating system within these time limitations as it
        is assumed that this will be quite similar to the base OS without the need for simplification, and thus not as
        representative of our project. By currently using existing enterprise remote access software such as team viewer
        we are able to show off the functionality and use of the project without building our own remote access
        software, as this would not be feasible in the current time constraints.
    </p>

    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        For this project we will possibly be using coding languages such as java or C# as well as various virtualization
        software, as well as some basic tools such as word or excel for writing up and planning thing and also various
        tools for designing concepts and mock-ups may include lucid chart or Figma as well as various tools from the
        adobe suite and hardware may include a minimum of an i7 processor, 32gb of ram and a dedicated video card with 8
        GB of Vram minimum. Generally depending on what version of the programming language we won’t need to pay any
        software licences but concerning the design tools, we would have to pay adobe yearly for using their product,
        and using these tools most of the group has a basic understanding as to how the tools are used and how it
        functions and half the group has access to the computation power that is necessary so we might need to invest
        more on upgrading.
    </p>

    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>
        For testing our app ‘Classy for schools’ we have decided that it would be best to include both formulative and
        summative usability testing. The point of these will be to respectively, give us insight on how we should go
        about designing our product from the early stages, and what changes we will need to be made towards the end of
        the design process to optimize our app.
    </p>
    <p>
        When deciding on the specific tests we were going to run, we had to keep in mind the target audience of our app.
        As they are children using a learning app, we figured that it would be appropriate to involve their parents and
        teachers within the testing process as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Testing at the beginning of our app will be aimed at shaping design direction, therefore the main information we
        will be looking to gather is how the user groups feel about features we are wanting to include in the app,
        getting their opinions on similar apps already in the market, and getting an idea of what the user desires from
        an app of our type. In this scenario, the process will involve providing parents and teachers a mock-up of our
        app, short project description and then asking them to fill in a survey regarding the app.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will find the parents and teachers to participate in our testing through a couple methods. We may get in
        contact with people we already know who fit this description and ask them to partake, if it turns out more
        numbers are needed it is an option to make contact with a local school and ask for parents and teachers from
        that school to partake in our testing.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the stage when summative testing begins, we would have hoped to be in the final stages of the design process.
        We will be looking to refine our app furthermore. This will involve getting back in contact with previously
        contacted parents and their children and asking them to partake in a lab-based user testing session. This will
        give us a chance to make observations while they perform tasks on the app. Afterwards parents would be asked to
        answer a questionnaire based on their experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        The success of our testing will be determined by the information we receive after the process is done. If we can
        receive information that has a meaningful input on the design direction and that guides us in making our product
        better, it means testing has been a success.
    </p>

    <h2>Timeframe</h2>

    <h2>Risks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>VM licensing issues</li>
        <li>Choosing which operating system to run through classy</li>
        <li>Difficulty in using Java to build a children's interface</li>
        <li>Possibly bugs within the code/ VM software</li>
        <li>Pricing of cloud hosting</li>
        <li>Pricing of the final product</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Group process and communications</h2>
    <p>
        Communication between all team members has been good this assignment which was carried over from our
        communication in assignment 2. As a group we communicate in two different ways. One being through a messenger
        group chat where we set meeting times, keep up to date with each other’s workload and what work we should do
        next. The other way we communicate is through Microsoft teams. During our meeting on teams we will do through
        what the assignment requires us to do, then we split some work among ourselves and then come back every couple
        of days to reassess the assignment then assign some more work for each of us to do. Sometimes we will do a
        meeting where we all complete a particularly large part of the assignment together instead of only one person
        taking on a larger workload then the rest of us. We usually have meeting once a week when we are all busy with
        other assignments but once we are all somewhat free to focus on this assignment more we will do meeting a lot
        more frequently where we will have meetings about once every two days. Fortunately for this group everybody
        responds to communication and nobody becomes unreachable. If that were to happen and nobody in the group could
        contact that group member at all then the next step would to be to talk to our tutor about trying to reach the
        group member, and see if the tutor can get in contact with the group member and what we should do about it in
        terms of work.
