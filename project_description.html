        <h1>Project Description</h1>
        <p>Classy for kids is a cloud-based learning alternative to other video chat services such as Teams and Zoom,
            classy is designed for a younger audience of prep to grade 6. Classy can be fully developed with the
            technology that is available today. Classy will be built on a server VM instance where the students will
            have access to said virtual machine, in this instance of the virtual machine the teacher will have to
            ability to control events to start programs open files and close programs. The virtual machine will start a
            video conference with the teacher and the whole class, the teacher will then be able to invite, kick, mute
            students in the session to help moderate the class. The Teacher will be able to interface with the
            cloud-based solution with a simple GUI so that they do not have to learn commands. The services to
            facilitate this solution already exist such as AWS cloud based VM. The software to interface with the VM and
            the video chat software will need to be developed, however similar programs exist such as Teams or Citrix,
            so it can be fully developed at this time. This project will heavily lean on the dependence of cloud-based
            computing and the ready access to servers to run the VM’s weather that is outsourced to a company such as
            Amazon or if the servers are purchased for the project.</p>
        <p>The most likely impact of the development of Classy for kids is schools may look in to providing learning
            from home services for students that need it such as students that are sick or for example have an auto
            immune disease that makes it so that going to school is a higher risk for them to get sick. Due to the ease
            of use of this program and how it will be able to facilitate teaching to school kids in a more efficient way
            while learning remotely is a first. Classy for kids will not make any jobs in schools redundant as it is not
            set out to replace normal in class learning rather it is designed to help those who for one reason or
            another cant attend the school physically not fall behind, or in the case of a pandemic assist in the remote
            learning of students. Classy for kids may have an impact on the current use of video conferencing programs
            such as WebEx or Teams in the use in schools, as Classy for kids comes with its own video conferencing
            software there is no need to pay extra to supplement the software with another video conferencing program,
            as well as it offering features that are more suited to a classroom environment rather than a cooperate
            environment that they were designed around.</p>
        <p>Classy for kids will not affect myself or people over the age of 13 that are not employed in primary school
            education, Classy is aimed at a target audience from prep to grade 6, and due to this it is very locked down
            in what the students can to, this is to help the teacher moderate the class and set assigned tasks as well
            as check the students current process and help then out if needed. Due to the locked down nature of the
            software it is not a good fit for students undertaking higher levels of education as the locked down model
            does not scale well when you are asking students to complete complex tasks involving multiple programs or
            self-directed research. This is going to affect people like my sister, she is in grade 6 so fits in to the
            target demographic, she is at the moment undertaking remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is
            finding it difficult to stay on task and find all the assigned work that is allocated to her. The students
            at the moment are also expected to install CISCO WebEx and learn how to use google classroom without any
            prior training, causing confusion and lost time that could be spend on teaching. Classy aims to dramatically
            reduce the wasted time spend on configuring those solutions by having all the required functions built in to
            one service, this helps the kids as all they have to do is click on a link and sign in with their assigned
            username and password and all the software is pre-installed and ready to go. Classy may also help with the
            adaption of a learn at home model due to its ease of use and the ability for the teacher to check on the
            students and reinforce learning points a lot better than any other method released currently.</p>

        <h1>Detailed Description</h1>
        <h2>Aims</h2>
        <p>
            The main aim to achieve for the development of Classy for Kids is the intercommunication between the web app
            and the VM environments. This would include the development of the web app and is dependent on the smaller
            goals that are also outlined below. This is our main goal because it is the final piece of software to
            develop to let the teachers actually use the software as outlined in the project description, with out this
            it can not meet the original requirements. <br> Some of the smaller goals to help achieve the main goal are
            as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Configure VM environments with pre-installed software. This will involve making a pre-configured
                environment for the VM server to run when a student logs in to the web app, it also includes having all
                the required services pre login to the students account so it is easier to use. This is a goal rather
                than the main aim because although it is necessary to be completed to ensure the most user-friendly
                experience for the students and the teachers, the core function of the software can still be achieved
                with the partial completion of this goal.</li>
            <li>Configure the video conferencing application to auto start and auto connect with a new VM login. This
                goal relates to the original description of the software of having the student auto connect to their
                class when they login, this is a usability feature and there fore is not the core aim as the same as
                above although it does need to be completed Classy can still function without the inclusion of this
                step.</li>
            <li>Program the commands from the web interface to the VM to control opening of programs and files. This
                goal is related to the original description where the teachers are able to click a button on their UI
                and open a file or program on all the students VM instances. This is a core function of the program but
                is still a sub division of the main aim as it related to the development of the web app and VM
                environments. This goal does need to be completed to reach the aim, as without this function Classy is
                not able to meet its original description.</li>
            <li>Organize the acquisition of licenses for the software required. Third part software will be used in
                Classy such as windows for the OS and some type of video conferencing tool that is to be decided later
                on in the project based on both cost and ease of programing the required functions in to it. We are
                going for some programs on licenses because it is decided that redeveloping programs such as the
                operating system is unnecessary and is outside our ability as software developers. This goal needs to be
                completed before Classy is publicly released to avoid issues with legality of using software that is not
                licensed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Goals that are required to be completed to reach the main aim are; Configure VM environments with
            pre-installed software, Program the commands from the web interface to the VM, and the acquisition of the
            required software. The first goal to be dropped in the instance of a time requirement should be the
            Configuration of the video conferencing application, as this can be fixed in a later patch and is not
            required for the core function of the software itself.</p>


        <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
        <p>
            This project has a lot of aspects and design elements to it and to do this a lot of planning and clear time
            frames must be set to make the project successful. We don’t plan on making the project do a complicated task
            such as the networking requirement of the live streaming nor do we plan on implementing some complicated
            code that talks with a server but we do plan on a coding aspect such as a basic login system and a main menu
            of the program and all the features and how it works will be implemented only in design phase while some
            features from the design phase will be implemented on the actual project. For this project we plan on making
            a basic outline of the project and thus creating concept art and developing some features for the project.
            First, we decide on some of the aims of the project and try to meet those aims when developing our webpage
            or program and while discussing aims we will be developing a timeframe and what the scopes and limits of the
            projects could be. We will also discuss the tools we will be using such as what type of software or what
            type of hardware is needed and whether we should use a paid service such as adobe. During the initial stages
            as well, we will be discussing general roles in the group as well as some risks that may occur. During the
            first week we will decide on how the project will or should look and we assign 2 or three people to design a
            concept for the login menu and parts of the main service and compare our designs by the end of the first
            week. Then after the first week during the weekdays, we will discuss who will be designing the main menu of
            the app and also start developing some of the feature set of the application and by the end of the second
            week, we will have multiple variations of the main menu as well as many U.I elements of the project. During
            the third and start of the fourth week will use the concepts most favored by the group and start developing
            a base using various coding languages such as java. The project in terms of developing the real application
            does not have to be fully complete only the aspect of the project that will give a general feel of the
            function of the product. All designs for what the project will look like is expected to be finished by the
            end week 11 or beginning of week 12 and during week 12 we will be testing the product in various ways with
            the bit of the project that is coded by having things such as other people using the product and giving us
            feedback.The project idea ‘Classy for kids’ originated from opportunities and the problems that have arisen
            due to this COVID 19 pandemic. Due to primary schools, high schools and universities being closed down in
            Australia and some other parts of the world to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus we had thought it would
            be a good idea to create something to emulate a real-life classroom with teachers, students and work being
            assigned, similar to what Microsoft teams, zoom and google classroom provide where they allow teachers and
            students to interact and learn but more focused on the younger year levels from prep to year 6 (primary
            school). The way we have originally designed ‘Classy for kids’ to work was that it would be cloud-based
            learning and it will be built on a server. The design of the application will allow teachers to have full
            control over the classroom/server with all their students in it. The teachers will be able to assign work to
            all students or individually to a student, they will be able to close programs and start programs for
            students, they will also be able to kick and mute students if needed as well as invite them to the
            classroom. Although the design of ‘Classy for kids’ will be simple, children in primary school may find it
            difficult or overwhelming to learn how to use the application so the teacher will be able to control
            everything for the students to avoid delays and confusion that the students may experience if they are the
            one operating and trying to find the work to do or other tasks that are required of them. It allows for a
            smoother and more comprehensive experience if the teacher can just assign the work to all students by
            uploading a file to the server then selecting all the students or only certain groups of students to be able
            to very clearly access it on their screen rather than each student going to go find the file which will
            undoubtedly create confusion and delays amongst primary school students. When the teacher uploads a file to
            the server the student will get a notification on their screen to open the work assigned by the teacher. We
            chose to do a virtual classroom for our idea because there is a lot of demand for this type of service
            currently and there is not a platform that specifically aims at primary school students so we thought that
            this would do pretty well and make a lot of money like the zoom is currently doing. Our aims of this project
            are to allow for an easy transition from the classroom to the online classroom without creating any further
            stress on teachers and parents about the students getting a proper education. Also, we want the students
            level of education that they get on our platform the emulate what they were getting in the classroom, it is
            very important that the students don’t feel overwhelmed by this temporary transition and hopefully, they can
            still stay focused on their work and education. This program progressed after an assignment 2 and a meeting
            with a tutor, we had decided to use the same project plan as we did in assignment to which was classy for
            kids and we had a rough idea as to what was supposed to in the project. There was a group discussion on the
            elements that we should keep or remove and expand and we decided to keep most of the features of the program
            and expanded it a bit but had to decide between and web-based interface or a program and decided to use a
            web-based app instead that the user doesn’t need to download on their desktop. Then after deciding on the
            what platform the app was going to be on we needed to decide on the roles of each of the group members, but
            a better idea was suggested that we switch roles or swap roles to suit a situation that best represented the
            member of the team's abilities so, there would be an original it lead but if they weren’t present than that
            would switch to the person most suitable or willing. After we had planned how the roles were going to be
            distributed in the assignment, we rewrote part of the project description and added or removed bits that
            weren’t necessary or Added features to the project description that were necessary for the project such as
            removing a monthly payment model for the program or making it exclusive to Windows 10. After writing a
            detailed description on what the project might look like we went forward with making an aim for the project
            which was that “achieve for the development of Classy for Kids is the intercommunication between the web app
            and the VM environments” and broke the aim of each task into smaller bits such as “Configure VM environments
            with pre-installed software” after making our aim than we had to make a plan for meeting and doing assigned
            work, so using Microsoft excel program we first divided the workload amongst ourselves and made deadlines
            for parts of the project that were due as well as setting up a meeting for when the whole group is meant to
            meet up again and do the new task for the project and by the second week of the assignment we had a plan and
            a concept but that had to be scrapped as it didn’t meet our expectations which set us back a bit and we had
            to create a new concept design of the project. During planning and concept phase of the assignment, we had a
            common goal of adding features most suitable to a classroom or educational environment which would include
            things such as a separate login for the teachers and students, we also added the ability for different types
            of logins in the project which would have allowed the user to loin in with various types of authentication
            such as a fingerprint read or facial recognition which was added after the planning and we started
            developing those features manly how it would look like and how it functioned but never got the part of
            actually implementing the ideas with code. When developing the feature we had several concept designs of
            various feature such as the login and live streaming aspects of the project but a lot had to been redone or
            scrapped since it didn’t reach our design philosophy of making it user friendly for an environment of
            children and make it for them easier to understand what various of the features do. We also had to revise
            many aspects of the project such as the design of the web interface as there was a lot of U.I elements that
            made it more complicated than it had to be and the group was focused on that for 1 week which set us back as
            we were focusing on designing the user interface and kept on revising it. After weeks of planning and
            creating concepts and idea’s for the project we had finally settled on a design the group could agree on but
            hadn’t reached the development phase of the program such as making a lock screen or prototype of the project
            as we had come to a lot of dead ends and problems due to our part as well as the current climate of the
            world, as the coronavirus made it difficult getting things needed as many of the stores were closed were
            locked limiting our access of necessary tools. Overall we only managed to make it up to the beginning stage
            of the concept phase and couldn’t get into the development phase which would have been more possible if our
            group could have met physically as it would have been easier communicating and getting much more done. Some
            stages of the aim couldn’t be met as the amount of time we had left was limited, the complexity of the aim
            or our understanding of a certain aim may have been limited which would have limited the feature set of the
            project if we reached the development stage which was missed due to our inefficient use of time and thus
            only allowing us to reach the concept beginning of the phase and we couldn’t do necessary things such as
            testing since we couldn’t make a working code for this project. So overall the design phase of the program
            had been reached and the group struggled to finish the design phase and entering the development stage for
            the project where we decided on doing finishing touches and refining the design of the project. During the
            project a lot of dead ends were made that could have been avoided and made our project more efficient and
            would have helped us read the beginnings of the development stage such as making a login or a basic program
            of the app to highlight it’s the main function. One dead-end was making tonnes of concepts and scrapping
            them since we could not decide on which was going to be best suited for the program design and that delayed
            us a lot as once the concept design was finished the group couldn’t agree with it and we had redoing the
            design again but only the login menu was done. Another dead end would have been the group meeting up as
            almost every time there was supposed to be a meeting it would have been delayed or no one would show up due
            to various reason so the timeframe for the project which became a dead end so we had to re-do times and
            reduce the frequency on the number of times we had to meet up. Another dead end would have been the amount
            of time we understand a certain task assigning it to only a person to do and it ends up being too difficult
            or requiring one person to do which had to be redone or scrapped since it wasn’t such a good idea. Lastly,
            some of the aims needed became a dead end in the project due to complexity of the certain task or under the
            experience of the group such as working with virtualization software which became a dead-end once we saw
            that not much could be done with it as we had no understanding as to how we should proceed and how to
            integrate it into our project. Another aspect which leads to dead ends was our design philosophy which was
            making it user friendly for children and less technical knowledged people which lead to many features being
            cut, revised or removed such as the ability to use an inbuilt VPN so better planning could have resolved
            many of the issues and dead ends experienced. In the future it is best to discuss our strengths and weakness
            more clearly and set more simple goals that we can build upon from and add to rather than assigning goals
            that are complicated and hard to design and implement which can help avoid dead ends. Consistency and
            communication is another way of avoiding dead ends as being on top of the plan designed can make the
            workload much easier and completing the task much faster and constant communication is also key as having
            contact with your group instead of tackling a problem solely relied on a person of the group can make doing
            the task more efficient. So overall we weren’t as successful as we would have liked to be but we managed to
            design the login page and some design elements of the project but there is the area for a lot of improvement
            such as setting up better aims, using designs that the group is sure of and meeting our deadlines in time
            which would have made the project more successful.
        </p>


        <h2>Roles</h2>
        <p>
            For this process, the roles of this group are not specific compared to last assignment as it is easier and
            more
            efficient to structure the group like this. One of the reasons for not giving a specific a specific role is
            availability, since when a meeting starts many of the members might not be present or attend this also
            applies
            to the leader like technical lead where the person with the most experience become technical lead until the
            original technical lead comes back. This could also apply to technical development where one person may know
            one
            area of the task assigned but have no idea of another so in order to assist with that, the person with the
            most
            technical know-how will be assigned to that role. Another reason might be that one group member might be
            confident in leading a specific task for the group and have a lot of knowledge of the specific task assigned
            and
            allows them to build on skills they might be lacking such as leadership or communication and allows them to
            grow
            that skill as they might be confident in that area of work and knows how to communicate it much better than
            they
            would other task. Lastly it will allow the team to do different task so they can be more engaged with the
            project and get assigned roles they might not be as comfortable such as a technical lead or design lead and
            help
            develop those sorts of skills.
        </p>

        <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
        <p>
            For our proof of concept we have prioritized the concept of remotely controlling a virtual machine in order
            to
            control students computers for educational purposes. This sets our secondary goal of the simplifying of the
            base
            OS for the easy and efficient use by a younger demographic to the side while we figure out the base
            framework
            that the application will run on. Due to this our scope is set as “building a successful remote virtual
            machine
            solution that we are able to widely distribute to the public”. For the sake of simplicity within this
            project we
            have decided that the base prototype model for this program will be a Windows OS based system. To achieve
            this
            we will be developing a .iso virtual image of a Window 10 based operating system with pre-installed remote
            desktop functionality, a file sharing database and the appropriate software settings to support these
            programs.
            We will not be designing the teacher/ host version of this operating system within these time limitations as
            it
            is assumed that this will be quite similar to the base OS without the need for simplification, and thus not
            as
            representative of our project. By currently using existing enterprise remote access software such as team
            viewer
            we are able to show off the functionality and use of the project without building our own remote access
            software, as this would not be feasible in the current time constraints.
        </p>

        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            For this project we will possibly be using coding languages such as java or C# as well as various
            virtualization
            software, as well as some basic tools such as word or excel for writing up and planning thing and also
            various
            tools for designing concepts and mock-ups may include lucid chart or Figma as well as various tools from the
            adobe suite and hardware may include a minimum of an i7 processor, 32gb of ram and a dedicated video card
            with 8
            GB of Vram minimum. Generally depending on what version of the programming language we won’t need to pay any
            software licences but concerning the design tools, we would have to pay adobe yearly for using their
            product,
            and using these tools most of the group has a basic understanding as to how the tools are used and how it
            functions and half the group has access to the computation power that is necessary so we might need to
            invest
            more on upgrading.
        </p>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
            For testing our app ‘Classy for schools’ we have decided that it would be best to include both formulative
            and
            summative usability testing. The point of these will be to respectively, give us insight on how we should go
            about designing our product from the early stages, and what changes we will need to be made towards the end
            of
            the design process to optimize our app.
        </p>
        <p>
            When deciding on the specific tests we were going to run, we had to keep in mind the target audience of our
            app.
            As they are children using a learning app, we figured that it would be appropriate to involve their parents
            and
            teachers within the testing process as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Testing at the beginning of our app will be aimed at shaping design direction, therefore the main
            information we
            will be looking to gather is how the user groups feel about features we are wanting to include in the app,
            getting their opinions on similar apps already in the market, and getting an idea of what the user desires
            from
            an app of our type. In this scenario, the process will involve providing parents and teachers a mock-up of
            our
            app, short project description and then asking them to fill in a survey regarding the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will find the parents and teachers to participate in our testing through a couple methods. We may get in
            contact with people we already know who fit this description and ask them to partake, if it turns out more
            numbers are needed it is an option to make contact with a local school and ask for parents and teachers from
            that school to partake in our testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the stage when summative testing begins, we would have hoped to be in the final stages of the design
            process.
            We will be looking to refine our app furthermore. This will involve getting back in contact with previously
            contacted parents and their children and asking them to partake in a lab-based user testing session. This
            will
            give us a chance to make observations while they perform tasks on the app. Afterwards parents would be asked
            to
            answer a questionnaire based on their experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            The success of our testing will be determined by the information we receive after the process is done. If we
            can
            receive information that has a meaningful input on the design direction and that guides us in making our
            product
            better, it means testing has been a success.

        <h2>Group process and communications</h2>
        <p>
            Communication between all team members has been good this assignment which was carried over from our
            communication in assignment 2. As a group we communicate in two different ways. One being through a
            messenger
            group chat where we set meeting times, keep up to date with each other’s workload and what work we should do
            next. The other way we communicate is through Microsoft teams. During our meeting on teams we will do
            through
            what the assignment requires us to do, then we split some work among ourselves and then come back every
            couple
            of days to reassess the assignment then assign some more work for each of us to do. Sometimes we will do a
            meeting where we all complete a particularly large part of the assignment together instead of only one
            person
            taking on a larger workload then the rest of us. We usually have meeting once a week when we are all busy
            with
            other assignments but once we are all somewhat free to focus on this assignment more we will do meeting a
            lot
            more frequently where we will have meetings about once every two days. Fortunately for this group everybody
            responds to communication and nobody becomes unreachable. If that were to happen and nobody in the group
            could
            contact that group member at all then the next step would to be to talk to our tutor about trying to reach
            the
            group member, and see if the tutor can get in contact with the group member and what we should do about it
            in
            terms of work.
