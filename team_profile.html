            <p>
                Hey! My name is James Henderson and I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT university.
                My family history consists of 1800s English/Irish settlers migrating to
                Byron Bay and settling in Ballarat during the gold rush. I speak a mix of English and Auslan (Australian
                sign language) at home with the primary language being English. I graduated
                high school last year at CBC St Kilda where I chose Legal Studies, Computing - Informatics, Further
                Mathematics, Psychology, English and CISCO Networking as my year 12 subjects.
                I am quite passionate about water sports and I regularly partake in hobbies such as swimming, surfing and
                lifesaving. I used to play hockey, AFL and chess for my high school's teams and eventually
                became an accredited U13s football coach. I have also recently joined the RMIT surfing and ultimate frisbee
                clubs.

            <h3>Career Path</h3>
            <p>
                The role of Cyber Security Analyst for the MFB involves the building and maintaining of a high level of security infrastructure ensuring all security requirements are met for the company. This includes responsibilities such as penetration testing to look for possible vulnerabilities in existing MFB systems, ensuring the MFB is compliant with all relevant security and data privacy standards, being able to work in a specialised team that identifies and eliminates possible external threats to the system and working with other departments to ensure that the relevant security needs are met throughout the entire company. This position is quite appealing to me as it involves my passion for cyber security and penetration testing while also allowing me to make a difference and help others by working in the emergency services department. Knowing the mission and goals of the company that I am working for is something that I value greatly when looking at future career paths and I believe the emergency service departments (especially Ambulance Victoria and MFB) reflect my moral goals of helping others in the community quite well, thus inclining me to choose this job.

            <h2>Joshua Kreppold</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Joshua Kreppold! (student 3838911) I am from the eastern suburbs Melbourne Australia and
                am studying a Bachelor of Information technology at RMIT.
                I completed year 12 in 2019 at Yarra Hills secondary collage where I've had some IT experience coding. We
                worked with php7 and the problem-solving methodology in the IT Software development class.
                Programming interests me because of its creative potential, but I am also taken in by User centered design
                because of the process of making something usable for other people.
                In my spare time I enjoy playing in the Vrl rugby competition with the boys from the Eastern Raptors, and I
                also enjoy playing video games when I can.

            <p>
                My name is Julian Chessari and I currently studying a bachelor of information technology at RMIT university.
                My background is Italian as my grandparents were born there but then immigrated to Melbourne Australia in
                1938, I only speak English though. I graduated Greythorn primary school in 2013 and graduated Balwyn High
                School
                in 2019 studying English, further mathematics, accounting, economics and legal studies. My main hobbies
                include playing games such as counter strike global offensive and rocket league on my PC. I

            <h3>Career Path</h3>
            <p>
                The job involves simulating cyber-attacks to inform future vulnerability, to allow for the prevention of that flaw, ensuring the company are complying to relevant data privacy and security standards. To translate risks in the system to the business to ensure prevention work is understood and carried out. To be part of a team that manages a constant monitoring system to ensure the organization is well equipped and prepared to detect, analyse, track and mitigate any external threats and to also work in collaboration with other teams within the company. I find this position appealing because the idea of eliminating external threats to the company seems to be very interesting work and something I might enjoy as a career. A base plan to enter this career would be to first graduate university with a bachelor of Information Technology. I would then try to get a job in Information Security roles, with hopefully involvement in a combination of assurance and risk management, systems design, security operations and auditing, I would try to get at least 5 years' experience in these roles. While doing this I would try get a certification in one or more of the following: CISSP, CEH, CISM, ISO 27001 or CompTia Security+.
